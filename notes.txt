CustomerAcquisition:
    - How do we vary marketing numbers based on inputs such as customer engagement
        ad spend or fares attended
    - Should we be splitting up the types of interested customers or do we just 
        change the distribution of customers gained based on target marketing
    - Is a binomial distribution with a sampled probability the correct way to 
        generate new active customers? Should this just be a simple percentage?
    - How do we best create the JSON / YAML for these distributions
    - Change organic, ads and events to lead_generation
    - lead_generation step on update as constant (distribution)

activeClients:
    - Add customer acquisition cost expense

Revenue:
    - Important to remember order of subscriptions to the clock. Should do clients first
        followed by revenue, followed by germination, building, maintenance and then 
        finally expenses
    - Logging every transaction might create a hell of a lot of text
    - How is best to report expenses? Keep a record or quote them as they happen?


Constants:
    - Materials
    - Labour costs
    - Prices: sale & subscriptions
    - Plants per unit
